      <h2>Character Selection</h2>
      <p>Selecting the right character is a huge part of the competitive scene.
      Some characters might not be the ideal character for the opponent you're up against.
      You have to know the opponent characters moveset and playstyle in order to choose the best
      character.</p>
      <h2>Neutral Game</h2>
      <p>Using neutral game to get the opening on your opponent is key to competitive gameplay.
        You have to be able to use projectiles or long-range moves to either psyche out the opponent
        or create a perfect opening to attack.</p>
